# What is Redis?
Redis is an in-memory multi-model database famous for its sub-millisecond latency. It was created in 2009 based on the idea that a cache can also be a durable data store.
Redis, which means remote dictionary server, was adopted by some of the most heavily trafficked sites in the world because it changed the database game by creating a system where data is always modified or read from the main computer memory as opposed to the much slower disk. But at the same time, it stores its data on the disk so it can be reconstructed as needed, which means the database is fully durable, supporting things like snapshots and backups. Every data point in the database is a key followed by one of many different data structures like a string, list, hash, or stream. So you can store data naturally, just like you would with your favorite programming language, as opposed to squeezing it into a bunch of tables or JSON documents.
